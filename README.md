Total: 60 marks · Question 1–3 carry 10 marks each, Question 4–5 carry 15 marks each.

## Question 1: Value Detective · 10 marks
Write a function describeValue that takes any value and returns a string with two pieces of information joined by a space, a pipe, and another space:

<type of the value> | <truthy or falsy>
Examples:

Call	Returns
describeValue("hello")	"string | truthy"
describeValue("")	"string | falsy"
describeValue(25)	"number | truthy"
describeValue(0)	"number | falsy"
describeValue(true)	"boolean | truthy"
describeValue(null)	"object | falsy"
describeValue(undefined)	"undefined | falsy"
Watch out for these three. Think before you answer:

describeValue("0") — a string that looks like zero
describeValue(NaN) — what does typeof NaN give?
describeValue(null) — remember the strange thing we saw in class
Hint: you do not need a long if chain to find the type. typeof gives it to you. And a value can be put straight inside an if to test truthy or falsy.

## Question 2: Bangladesh Weekend Machine · 10 marks
Write a function getDayType that takes a day name and returns:

Input day	Returns
Friday, Saturday	"Weekend"
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday	"Working Day"
anything else	"Invalid Day"
You must solve this with switch case, not with if / else.

It must also work when the student enters the day in any letter case:

Call	Returns
getDayType("Friday")	"Weekend"
getDayType("friday")	"Weekend"
getDayType("MONDAY")	"Working Day"
getDayType("Bandarban")	"Invalid Day"
Hint: two case lines can share one result if you do not put break between them. And a string method can fix the letter case before the switch starts.

## Question 3: Username Gatekeeper · 10 marks
Write a function validateUsername that takes a username and checks it against these rules, in this order:

Shorter than 4 characters → return "Too Short"
Contains a space → return "No Space Allowed"
Contains the word admin anywhere, in any letter case → return "Reserved Word"
Otherwise → return "Available"
The order matters. Look at the third example carefully.

Call	Returns	Why
validateUsername("rahim123")	"Available"	passes every rule
validateUsername("ab")	"Too Short"	only 2 characters
validateUsername("a b")	"Too Short"	it has a space, but the length rule is checked first
validateUsername("abcd")	"Available"	exactly 4 is allowed
validateUsername("rahim islam")	"No Space Allowed"	
validateUsername("superadmin99")	"Reserved Word"	admin is in the middle
validateUsername("Admin_Rahim")	"Reserved Word"	capital A must also be caught
Hint: .length, .includes(), and .toLowerCase().

## Question 4: Dhaka CNG Fare Meter · 15 marks
Write a function getCngFare(distance, isNight, waitingMinutes) that returns the total fare in taka.

Fare rules:

The minimum fare is 50 taka, and it covers the first 2 km.
Every km after the first 2 km costs 15 taka.
Waiting charge: 2 taka for every waiting minute.
At night, the driver adds 20% on the whole fare — that means on the distance charge and the waiting charge together.
isNight should default to false and waitingMinutes should default to 0, so getCngFare(5) must work on its own.
Return the number, do not round it and do not add the word "taka".

Call	Returns	Working
getCngFare(2)	50	minimum fare
getCngFare(1)	50	still the minimum, never less
getCngFare(5)	95	50 + (3 × 15)
getCngFare(10)	170	50 + (8 × 15)
getCngFare(5, false, 10)	115	95 + (10 × 2)
getCngFare(5, true)	114	95 + 20%
getCngFare(5, true, 10)	138	115 + 20%
Hint: build the fare step by step in a let variable, then apply the night charge at the very end.

## Question 5: Run Chase Commentator · 15 marks
Write an arrow function getChaseVerdict(target, scored, ballsLeft) for a cricket run chase.

Steps:

runsNeeded = target - scored

If runsNeeded is 0 or less, the match is already won → return "Won"

Otherwise, if ballsLeft is 0 or less, there is no ball left to score → return "Lost"

Otherwise, work out the required run rate:

requiredRate = (runsNeeded / ballsLeft) * 6
Pick the verdict from the rate:

Required rate	Verdict
6 or less	"Comfortable"
more than 6, up to 12	"Tough"
more than 12	"Almost Impossible"
Return this exact sentence:

Need <runsNeeded> runs in <ballsLeft> balls | <verdict>
Always write runs and balls, even when the number is 1.

Call	Returns
getChaseVerdict(200, 200, 12)	"Won"
getChaseVerdict(200, 190, 0)	"Lost"
getChaseVerdict(100, 90, 12)	"Need 10 runs in 12 balls | Comfortable"
getChaseVerdict(100, 80, 12)	"Need 20 runs in 12 balls | Tough"
getChaseVerdict(100, 70, 12)	"Need 30 runs in 12 balls | Almost Impossible"
getChaseVerdict(150, 149, 1)	"Need 1 runs in 1 balls | Comfortable"
Hint: use a template string for the sentence. Write it as const getChaseVerdict = (target, scored, ballsLeft) => { ... };

Rules
Use the exact function names given. Spelling and capital/small letters must match.

Every function must return its answer. Do not use console.log for the answer.

// ❌ this gives 0
function add(a, b) { console.log(a + b); }

// ✅ this is correct
function add(a, b) { return a + b; }
Return the text exactly as shown, including spaces and capital letters. "Weekend" is correct, "weekend" is not.

You may only use what we covered in class: variables, operators, strings, template strings, if / else, switch, ternary, and functions. No arrays, no loops, no objects.

Part marks are given. If your function works for some cases but not all, you still get marks for the cases that work. So attempt every question, even if you cannot make it perfect.

File Structure
Write all five answers in one file and name it answer.js
You may use comments to specify the question number (example: //Question No. 1)
